# UAV-Wing-Optimization
Engineering project focused on UAV wing optimization using XFOIL, AVL, and ANSYS Fluent while applying real-world constraints. Analyzes multiple airfoils and wing planform configurations to evaluate lift, drag, and efficiency at low Reynolds numbers, demonstrating aerodynamic modeling, simulation, and design trade-off analysis.
